# MLDeform

A library for machine learning of skeletal deformations on a skinned mesh.

This will try and make the logic as DCC agnostic as possible but the main target implementation will be
Autodesk Maya 2018 and above.

I encourage others to help improve this repo or to add implementations for other applications.


    
## Usage

### Installation

If you have the dependencies above installed, you can install this package by placing the MLDeform directory anywhere
on your `PYTHONPATH`.

If you're using Maya you can place the MLDeform directory in your scripts directory.

### Simplifying Skinning

This method requires that each joint have a single influence.
We'll still use standard skinning with joints to provide stability to the deformation.
However since each vertice only has one influence and no other deformations, the skinning is much faster and efficient.

To simplify the skinning, in Maya you can run the following:

```python

from MLDeform import skinning

# Get a target mesh.
target = 'Tube'

# Clone it (you can do this yourself too)
mesh = skinning.clone_mesh(target)

# Skin the clone. You can also handle this yourself too.
skinning.skin_mesh(mesh)

# Finally simplify the weights
skinning.simplify_weights(mesh, fast=False)

```

### Writing Data

We need to write data to train the machine learning system

```python
from MLDeform import writer

# Write out the data to this location
# Will default to your Maya directory if none is given
outdir = 'Path/To/Write/To'

# Write the data out to the above location
path = writer.write(mesh, target, outdir=outdir)

```

### Training Models

Now we train the models!

```python
from MLDeform import train
training_data = train.train(path) # If you don't have matplotlib, set plot=False
print(training_data)

```

### Deform

You can load the deformer by running:

```python
from MLDeform import deformer
deformer.load_plugin()

```

Additionally you can add `MLDeform._maya` to your `MAYA_PLUGIN_PATH` so Maya can always find the plugin.
Otherwise you will need to run this every time.

Create the deformer using

```python
from maya import cmds
deformer = cmds.deformer(mesh, type='mldeformer')

```

Finally set the location of the `output_data.json` on the deformer and connect the joints up.
Take a look at the `test_deformer` function to see how to set this up on a sample scene.

The deformer will now load up the Tensorflow models we wrote earlier and predict values based on the
transforms of the joints it has been given.

## Notes

This repo is not very mature.
Known issues:

* Normalization causes deformation issues. Still need to fix it.
* No C++ deformer for Maya yet
* Data structure may change to be lighter.

## Dependencies
 
 There are a few Python depencies you will need.
 
 ### Required
 
 * **six**
   
   Needed for supporting Python2 and Python3
   
 * **tensorflow**
 
    Required for the actual training and deformers.
    
    **NOTE:** Some platforms have issues importing Tensorflow into Maya.
    
    To workaround this, you need to add a file called `__init__.py` to the `google` package so that it can be imported properly.
    
    Find the google package by running `from google import protobuf;print(protobuf.__file__)`.
    This gives you the location of the protobuf folder.
    The parent directory will be the google package.
 
* **pandas**

    Necessary for efficient processing of data objects
    
  ### Optional
  
  
  * **matplotlib**
  
    If you intend to display trainign plots, this is an optional requirement.
